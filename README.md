# Roadmap

- [ ] allow users to receive daily summary email instead of each individual email notifications
- [ ] generate summary email with all group information when archived group is being deleted - keeps your data in your mailbox for backup
- [ ] allow group owner to mark group as reviewed for other members - streamlines the whole process
- [ ] allow group owner to mark expenses as settled up for other members - streamlines the whole process
- [ ] allow users to resend invitation emails
- [ ] add option to resend authentication email for better user experience
- [ ] do not allow users to have same name - all users in the system (or at least within the same group) should have unique names to avoid confusion
- [ ] send notification email to group owner when members review the expenses
- [ ] send notification email to group members when other members settle up with them
- [ ] solve confusion of users with same name within the group
- [ ] better error handling
